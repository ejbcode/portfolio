    <p>
      I like to make stuff for the web. I'm a Systems Engineer, passionate about
      technology, I like to resolve design problems, create smart user interface
      and imagine useful interaction, developing rich web experiences & web
      applications. I have experience with React, Redux, javascript, ES6, CSS,
      HTML5, I have been working and learning more every day on this subject and
      I'm always excited to learn a new language or framework. Out of the office
      youâ€™ll find me dreaming of soccer, playing bass guitar, and petting all
      the good dogs. I am a person who loves to spend time coding or learning I
      love learning new things and staying up-to-date with the latest web
      technologies.
