          I like to make stuff for the web. I'm a Systems Engineer, passionate
          about technology, I like to resolve design problems, create smart user
          interface and imagine useful interaction, developing rich web
          experiences & web applications. I have experience with React, Redux,
          javascript, ES6, CSS, HTML5, I have been working and learning more
          every day on this subject and I'm always excited to learn a new
          language or framework. Out of the office youâ€™ll find me dreaming of
          soccer, playing bass guitar, and petting all the good dogs. I am a
          person who loves to spend time coding or learning I love learning new
          things and staying up-to-date with the latest web technologies.
