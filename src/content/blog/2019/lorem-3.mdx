# Movie Night

1. Some movie
2. Another movie
3. Definitely not one of the Avenger movies

## An Code example with PrismJS

Gatsby-Starter-Julia uses the Atom Editor Theme.

```js
import React from "react";
import { graphql } from "gatsby";
import { MDXRenderer } from "gatsby-plugin-mdx";

const ComponentName = ({ data }) => {
  const postData = data.allMdx.nodes[0];
  return (
    <>
      <MDXRenderer>{postData.body}</MDXRenderer>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 4)}</pre>
    </>
  );
};

export default ComponentName;
```

## Default NodeJS server

```css
:root {
  --colorBg: #252835;
  --colorTxt: #fff;
  --colorTxt2: #fdba21;
  --colorTxt3: #ccc;
  --red: #ff4949;
  --black: #2e2e2e;
  --yellow: #fdba21;
  --white: #fff;
  --gray: #696969;
}

*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

h1 {

}

}

  color: white;
  border: 0;
  padding: 0.6rem 1rem;
  border-radius: 2px;

}

.section-container {
  padding-top: 20px;
  padding-bottom: 80px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  max-width: 980px;
}
```

```jsx
const http = require('http');
  <SEO title="Home" />

    <Hero bg={data.bg} />

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World\n');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```

# I find your lack of faith disturbing.

All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… What!? I find your lack of faith disturbing.

I don't know what you're talking about. **I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.** _Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander._ There'll be no one to stop us this time!

## I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.

I call it luck. As you wish. Ye-ha! The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.

1. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.
2. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.
3. Partially, but it also obeys your commands.

### Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.

Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. What?! The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.

- What!?
- Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.
- Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.

What!? The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.

I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. I find your lack of faith disturbing. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly…

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. I'm trying not to, kid. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.

As you wish. I find your lack of faith disturbing. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

I'm trying not to, kid. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!

Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? As you wish. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--

I'm trying not to, kid. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.

I'm trying not to, kid. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.

Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. You mean it controls your actions? Don't underestimate the Force. What!?

I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.

But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!
