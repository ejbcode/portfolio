# Automatically generates PropTypes code for React components

PropTypes are a mechanism to ensure that components use the correct data type and pass the right data, and that components use the right type of props, and that receiving components receive the right type of props.

Although the process only takes a minute, it can be a pain point of React development, especially when a component takes a large number of props. That is why some developers bypass PropTypes because of the small amount of extra up-front coding required.
