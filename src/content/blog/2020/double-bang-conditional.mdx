# Double !Bang conditional

TLDR;

The !! (double bang) logical operators return a value’s truthy value.

```js
let data = undefined;

console.log(!data); //true
console.log(!!data); //false
```

Have you ever had problems accessing a nested object property?
You might not know if the object or one of the sub-properties
exists, and this can cause frustrating errors.

Let’s say we wanted to access a property called data within
state , but data is undefined until our program has successfully
returned a fetch request. Depending on where we use it, calling
data could prevent our app from running.

```js
fetch("https://www.breakingbadapi.com/api/quote/random")
  .then((resp) => resp.json())
  .then((data) => setState(data));
//from data we want to extract the author and the quote
const { author, quote } = data[0];
// But this if  going to throw a error because data if undefined
//until the request returned the promise.

const { author, quote } = !!data && data[0];
// author and quote will be false until data have a value,
// then de variables will be the result of data[0]
```
