# "Using setState Without an access to the state"

When we want to update the state but without losing the current state,
we must make a copy of the state and then update it.
This is generally done with the spred operator.

```js
const Search = ({ keywords, setKeywords }) => {
  setKeywords([keywords, ...key]);
};
```

But in this example we do it without reciving the keywords by props to the component,
using a callback

```js
const Search = ({ setKeywords }) => {
  setKeywords((key) => [value, ...key]);
};
```
