# Color Customization of the title bar in VsCode

Changing the color of the title bar provides an easy way to identify your windows when there are more than two opened.

To create a local customization per project, create a folder with the name of _.vscode_ in the root of your project, then create the file _settings.json_ and paste the next code:

**.vscode/settings.json**

```json
{
  "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "titleBar.activeForeground": "#000", // The font color of the title Bar
    "titleBar.inactiveForeground": "#000000CC",
    "titleBar.activeBackground": "#FFC600", //The color of the title Bar
    "titleBar.inactiveBackground": "#FFC600CC" // Color, when is inactive
  },
}

P.D.: If you put the config in the global settings, will affect all the projects.

```
