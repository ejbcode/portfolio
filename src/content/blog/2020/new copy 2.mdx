# New

1- First create a repository named _my-app_ using create-react-app.

```
npm init react-app my-app
```

2- We need to install GitHub Pages package as a dev-dependency.

```
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
```

3- Add properties to _package.json_ file.

The first property we need to add at the top level homepage second we will define this as a string and the value will be "http://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}" {username} is your GitHub username, and {repo-name} is the name of the GitHub repository you created it will look like this :

"homepage": "http://ejbcode.github.io/my-app"

Second in the existing scripts property we to need to add predeploy and deploy.

"scripts": {
//...
"predeploy": "npm run build",
"deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}

4- Create a Github repository and initialize it and add it as a remote in your local git repository.

Now, create a remote GitHub repository with your app name and go back initialize this
git init
add it as remote
git remote add origin git@github.com:ejbcode/my-app.git

5- Now deploy it to GitHub Pages.

just run the following command :

npm run deploy

successful build

this command will create a branch named gh-pages this branch host your app, and homepage property you created in package.json file hold your link for a live preview, or you can open the branch setting scroll down to GitHub Pages section you will find this:
Your site is puplished

Visit deployed app

6- commit and push your commit to GitHub. Optionally

```
git add .
git commit -m "Your awesome message"
git push origin master
```
