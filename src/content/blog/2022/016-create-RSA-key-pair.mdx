# What is RSA?

_RSA_ is the most popular and widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm available to the public. It also happens to be the very first asymmetric encryption algorithm.

Its name is derived from the surnames of the three mathematicians (Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman) who invented it.

Type the command below and hit enter to generate the private key.

```bash
openssl genrsa -out privatekey.pem 2048
```

Once the above command is executed successfully, a file named "privatekey.pem" will be created on your present directory. The "2048" above specifies the private key size. You can modify it accordingly depending on your required size.

Proceed to export the public key from the key pair generated using the command below

```bash
openssl rsa -in privatekey.pem -out public.pem -pubout -outform PEM
```

Another file named "publickey.pem" will be created in the directory
