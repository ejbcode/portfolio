# Ways to Remove a Property from an Object in Js

Sometimes we need to return a object but with less properties. For the next example let´s see two approaches

```JS
const person = {
  name:'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  gender: 'Male',
  passport: 'A112332'
}
```

## BlackList approach

With this approach, we destructure de properties that we don´t want to return and spreed the rest to return it

```JS
const {passport, ...rest} = person;
console.log(rest)
// {name: "John", lastName: "Doe", gender: 'Male'}
```

## WhiteList approach

Sometimes is much easier to declare what properties we need to return. We can make a function that receives the object, but filter the desired values

```JS
const exampleFilter = ({ name, lastName }) => ({ name, lastName })
console.log(exampleFilter(person))
// {name: "John", lastName: "Doe"}
```

## Bonus

We can use lodash

```JS
const _ = require("lodash");
console.log(_.omit(person, ['gender', 'passport']));
// {name: "John", lastName: "Doe"}
```
