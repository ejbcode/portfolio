# NextJs 101

Right out of the box, Next.js provides things like pre-rendering, routing, code splitting, and webpack support.

- [Live Demo](https://nextjs-scratch.vercel.app/)
- [Repo en github](https://github.com/ejbcode/nextjs-scratch)

## Install

To create a project, run:

```bash
npm init keystone-app my-app
```

You'll be prompted with a few questions:

- What is your project name? Pick any name for your project. You can change it later if you like.
- Select a starter project. These are some preconfigured projects you can use as the base of your own application.
- Select a database type. Choose between MongoDB and PostgreSQL.
- Where is your database located? Provide the connection string for your database.
- Test your database connection. Test that Keystone can connect to your database.

Once you have answered these questions, Keystone will be installed in a project directory. This will take a few minutes, as there are a number of dependencies which need to be downloaded and installed.

Once your project has been set up you should move into its directory so that you can start using it

âˆš What is your project name? ... keystone101
âˆš Select a database type Â» MongoDB
âˆš Where is your database located? ... mongodb+srv://keystone123:keystone123@keystonecluster.rlmni.mongodb.net/keystone101?retryWrites=true&w=majority
âˆš Test database connection? ... No / Yes
(node:244) DeprecationWarning: Listening to events on the Db class has been deprecated and will be removed in the next major version.âˆš Successfully connected to mongodb+srv://keystone123:keystone123@keystonecluster.rlmni.mongodb.net/keystone101?retryWrites=true&w=majority
âˆš Select a starter project Â» Blank

cd my-app
npm run dev

change the port 3000 for avoid futere problem with the frontend in the future

npm i dotenv

create a .env file

MONGO_URI='mongodb+srv://USER:PASSWORD@keystonecluster.rlmni.mongodb.net/keystone101?retryWrites=true&w=majority'

COOKIE_SECRET="literally anything you want"

IMPORT `const dotenv = require('dotenv').config()`

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Pages

All React Component exported from a .js, .jsx, .ts, or .tsx file in the pages directory will become a page. Each page is associeted with a route based on its own file name.

**Example:**
If you create a React Component like below

```JS
const welcome = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      Welcome
    </div>
  )
}

export default welcome

```

it will be accessible at _/welcome_ with no need to import a router

## Layout

The _\_app.js_ file wraps around all of your page components, so it's a good place to put our Layout component.

_page/\_app.js_

```JS
import Layout from '../components/Layout'
import '../styles/globals.css'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <Layout>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
    </Layout>
  )
}

export default MyApp
```

```JS
import React from 'react'

const Layout = ({children}) => {
  return (
    <div>
      Header
        <div className="main">
          {children}
        </div>
      Footer
    </div>
  )
}

export default Layout
```

## Head Component

Head is a 'next/head' component that can be imported from any Next.js page component to add information to the page header. In this component you can customize the page title, all of the website metadata, page keywords, viewport settings

```HTML
 <Head>
    <title>NextJS 101</title>
    <meta charSet="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width" />
  </Head>
```

This should be imported in each page, but we can create a Layout with the Head component in it.
_e.g:.:_

```JS
import Head from 'next/head'

const Meta = ({ title, keywords, description }) => {
  return (
    <Head>
      <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1' />
      <meta name='keywords' content={keywords} />
      <meta name='description' content={description} />
      <meta charSet='utf-8' />
      <link rel='icon' href='/favicon.ico' />
      <title>{title}</title>
    </Head>
  )
}

Meta.defaultProps = {
  title: 'My App Title',
  keywords: 'nextjs, react',
  description: 'Next From scratch',
}

export default Meta

```

## Link component

Similar to what we would do with React-Router we use Link to navigate between pages imported from next
import Link from "next/link";

```JS
<Link href="/">
  <a>home</a>
</Link>
```

With that in mind, now we can create a Nav component to navigate through our links and then imported in the Layout component

```js
import Link from "next/link";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

const Nav = () => {
  const router = useRouter();
  return (
    <nav className="nav">
      <ul>
        <li className={router.pathname == "/" ? "active" : ""}>
          <Link href="/">
            <a>home</a>
          </Link>
        </li>
        <li className={router.pathname == "/welcome" ? "active" : ""}>
          <Link href="/welcome">
            <a>Welcome</a>
          </Link>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  );
};

export default Nav;
```

## Image Component

The Next.js Image component allow you're to take advantage of lazy loading as well as optimizations around image sizes.
Next.js optimizes images on-demand, as users request them. Unlike static site generators and static-only solutions, your build times aren't increased, whether shipping 10 images or 10 million images.

```JS
import Image from 'next/image'

const Nav = () => {

  const router = useRouter()
  return (
    <div className="nav">
      <Image src="/logo.png"  alt="site logo"  width={90} height={50}/>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Nav

```

## Data Fetching and Rendering

Next.js provide two forms of pre-rendering: Static Generation and Server-side that differ when generates the HTML for a page.

Static Generation is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at build time. The pre-rendered HTML is then reused on each request.
Server-side Rendering is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on each request
In the Static Generation, the HTML pages are rendered at build time.

### Static Generation with getStaticProps

```JS
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch(`https:....`)
  const data = await res.json()

  return {
    props: {
      data
    }
  }
}
```

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out the Vercel [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
